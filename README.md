# Vue.js Core Concepts Practice

Welcome! 👋 This project was created as part of my journey to deepen my understanding of **Core Vue.js practices**. The goal is to explore and experiment with the fundamental concepts that make up modern frontend development with Vue.js.

## 📚 Based On

This project is based on the course **[Vue - The Complete Guide](https://www.udemy.com/course/vuejs-2-the-complete-guide/)** by **Maximilian Schwarzmüller**. The course has been an incredible resource for learning both the fundamentals and advanced features of Vue.js.

## 🔍 What I'm Learning

This project focuses on the following Vue.js concepts:

- **Vue Instance** – Understanding the root of every Vue app
- **Templates and Data Binding** – Reactive UI with interpolation and directives
- **Components** – Building reusable and composable UI blocks
- **Props and Events** – Communication between components
- **Computed Properties and Watchers** – Efficiently reacting to data changes
- **Directives** – Using built-in directives like `v-if`, `v-for`, `v-model`
- **Vue Router** – Client-side routing and navigation
- **Vuex** – Centralized state management
- **Lifecycle Hooks** – Managing component lifecycle events
- **Mixins and Plugins** – Reusing and extending Vue functionality
- **Transitions and Animations** – Adding smooth UI effects
- **And More** – Additional best practices and Vue patterns as I progress

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- Vue.js 2
- JavaScript (ES6+)
- Vue CLI or webpack (depending on setup)
- CSS or component-level styling
